### Cornell student in court over antisemitic threats
~~~
A student at an elite New York college has been held in jail after appearing in court accused of posting violent threats against Jewish students.
Prosecutors say Patrick Dai, 21, made threats to bring a gun to the Cornell University campus and rape Jewish women and "behead any Jewish babies".
He has been charged with posting threats to kill or injure another using interstate communications.
